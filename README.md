# Battleship Node Reviews

This repository is used to review anonymized candidate submissions only.

If you want to ask questions about or suggest changes to the Node version of the Battleship interview exercise, please see https://github.com/github/battleship-node.

In addition to candidate submission branches, some branches in this repository are point in time snapshots of the base exercise, which the candidate submissions are opened against. This allows iteration on the base exercise without encountering a stop-the-world period for interviews by enabling multiple versions of the exercise to be run concurrently.

Those base branches are protected and should not be changed once created.

To find out which branch is currently used for the interview exercise, look at the [process.json file for the exercise](https://github.com/github/engineering/blob/master/interviewing/application-engineer/assets/process.json).
